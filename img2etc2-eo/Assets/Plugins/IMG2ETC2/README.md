A utility that allows you to bring the image resolution to a multiple of 4 for compression to work correctly.

ETC is a block-based texture compression format. 
The image is split up into 4x4 blocks, and each block is encoded using a fixed number of bits.
Only textures with width/height being multiple of 4 can be compressed to Crunch format.

You can get acquainted with the parameters on the Unity3D [documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.2/Documentation/Manual/class-TextureImporterOverride.html), or read this [post](https://unity.com/ru/blog/engine-platform/crunch-compression-of-etc-textures).
