This repository is a practice of writing programs in the spirit of [Elegant Objects](https://www.elegantobjects.org/).

### Plans:
- [ ] Refactoring in the spirit of Elegant Objects;
- [ ] Adding tests;
- [ ] Adding the ability to scroll through the list by pages;
- [ ] Updates to the main repository;
